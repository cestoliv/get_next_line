# get_next_line

```
FINAL GRADE: 125/100

Here is my get_next_line, I struggled a long time with the leaks ;)

It has been tested with the following test:
- [https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester)

Improvements to consider (even if this program is particularly fast):
- Make sure to secure all returns of functions that have malloc (e.g. ft_substr)
- Free all that is malloc when returning NULL
- It may be possible to do the bonus without a static chained list
